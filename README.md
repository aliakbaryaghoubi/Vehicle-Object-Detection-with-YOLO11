# Vehicle-Object-Detection-with-YOLO11
IMT Deep Learning Course Project 4

YOLO (You Only Look Once), a popular object detection and image segmentation model, was developed by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi at the University of Washington. Launched in 2015, YOLO quickly gained popularity for its high speed and accuracy. ([The source paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640))

In this repository, three different variants of YOLO11, including YOLO11n, YOLO11s, and YOLO11m, are trained on a dataset containing images from five vehicle categories. The code iterates over the three models and trains them for 100 epochs. In each YOLO variant, the model's predictions, based on the pre-trained settings and trained weights, are displayed.
